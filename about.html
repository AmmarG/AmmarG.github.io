                <p>The Arab Policy Forum (APF) was established as an initiative to provide quality data and information on the Middle East, generated from empirical research and data analysis. By bringing together regional and international researchers, analysts, scholars, lawmakers and officials, APF aims to support policymakers in their decision-making processes and provide key content for media analysis across the media landscape.</p>
                <p>APF will provide a dedicated data service which engages in academic research to build regional datasets. This data will be reviewed and discussed on numerous levels based on APF’s governance policies and communications strategy.</p>

                <h2>Our Units</h2>
            </div>
            <p>As a multifaceted initiative, APF will be comprised of five units, each with a core function.</p>
            <p>The Research Unit is at the core of APF’s work, enabling APF to define its own research agenda and cooperate to conduct research consultancies internationally. The Research Unit will be responsible for generating relevant and long-term research agendas, driven by three main research interests: “Conflict,” “Empowerment,” and “Energy.”
            </p>
            <p>To complement its research, APF will establish a Data Unit with a focus on data generation and aggregation. One of the major obstacles for MENA researchers is a lack of access to reliable and timely information. To help overcome this hurdle, the Data Unit will pursue three main objectives:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To collect, organize, and document existing information in an accessible database.</li>
                <li>To gather new information based on APF’s research agenda.</li>
                <li>To design, collect and organize information on demand for third parties.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Data Unit will work through two main strategies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Conducting specialized surveys that feed APF’s research.</li>
                <li>Giving advice on the design, collection, and organization of information to other institutions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>APF’s Public Policy Unit will serve as a forum for policy debate and analysis based on data-driven research. The unit will oversee events such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Research Workshops: Spaces where researchers can present preliminary research findings and receive feedback from experts.
                </li>
                <li>Evidence-based Meetings: Hosted gatherings of regional and international experts to discuss available evidence and policy solutions.</li>
                <li>Roundtables: Closed meetings between researchers and policymakers to discuss specific policy challenges.</li>
                <li>Debate Workshops for Young Researchers: Talks and debates which will encourage an interactive and evidence-based policy culture among young researchers.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Through its Public Policy Unit, APF will also work to promote local research in the MENA region. It aims to launch an annual research contest for youth on research topics important which are important to the MENA region and in line with APF’s research concentration.</p>
            <p>To build capacity, the APF’s Thought Sustainability Unit will deliver training sessions and workshops on research methods and public management. This training will be delivered internally, to strengthen internal capacities, and externally, to share research methods and skills with civil society professionals and public officials.</p>
            <p>The Administration Unit will be established to manage and coordinate administrative and financial matters.</p>
